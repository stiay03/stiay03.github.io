# *The Legacy of Claude Monet*


*Who is Claude Monet? and why is he so significant in the development impressionist painting?*

Oscar-Claude Monet, a French painter who established impressionist painting,
is regarded as a major influence on
modernism because of his efforts to capture nature as he saw it.

Monet was born on November 14, 1840 and was raised in Le Havre, Normandy. 
Starting from an early age, Monet was interested in drawing despite the fact that his father
Claude Adolphe, disapproved and wanted him to pursue a life in business. 

Even after this, he still remained close with his mother, Louise-Justine Aubree Monet, who
continued to support her beloved son's dreams and goals in life. He went on to study at the Academie Suisse. 
Later on in life, Monet proceeded to reside in Germany. where he purchased a house and property
that he used to create a vast landscaping project, inlcuding a water-lily pond

Monet's desire to portray the light and seasonal changes in the French countryside prompted him to adopt a technique of repeatedly painting the same area. Among the most well-known are his haystack series (1890–1891), the paintings of the Rouen Cathedral (1892–1894), and the water lily paintings in his Giverny garden, which he painted nonstop for the final 20 years of his life.
